⚡What is synchronized in Java?
synchronized is a keyword in Java used to control access to a shared resource in multithreading.
It ensures that only one thread at a time can execute a block of code or method, preventing data inconsistency.

⚡Why use synchronized?
To make code thread-safe
To prevent race conditions (multiple threads modifying the same data at the same time)
To ensure correct results when multiple threads work on shared resources
Ways to use synchronized:

⚡Synchronized Method – the whole method is locked:
public synchronized void increment() {
    count++;
}


⚡Synchronized Block – only part of the code is locked:
public void increment() {
    synchronized(this) {
        count++;
    }
}
📌
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;
    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }
    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}
public class TestSync {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Counter c = new Counter();
        c.increment(); // only one thread can increment at a time
    }
}
