128.✅Longest Consecutive Sequence
Example 1:
Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
✅ Approach (HashSet Method — Best & Optimal)
1.Insert all numbers into a HashSet
	This allows quick lookup (O(1)).
2.Loop through each number in the set and check:
	If the number is the start of a sequence, meaning (num - 1) is NOT in the set.
	This ensures we only start counting from the first element of a consecutive chain.
3.Count consecutive numbers
	Keep increasing count: num+1, num+2, … as long as they exist in the set.
4.Track the maximum streak length.

class Solution {
    public int longestConsecutive(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
        HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (int num : nums) {
            set.add(num);
        }
        int longestStreak = 0;
        for (int num : set) {
            // Check if it's the start of a sequence
            if (!set.contains(num - 1)) {
                int currentNum = num;
                int currentStreak = 1;
                // Count the streak
                while (set.contains(currentNum + 1)) {
                    currentNum++;
                    currentStreak++;
                }
                longestStreak = Math.max(longestStreak, currentStreak);
            }
        }
        return longestStreak;
    }
}
