155.✅Min Stack
✅Approch:
How It Works
When pushing a value:
Push into mainStack.
Compare value with minStack.peek():
If minStack is empty OR new value <= current min → push it into minStack.
When popping:
Pop from mainStack.
If both top values are equal → pop from minStack too.
getMin() → return top of minStack.
✅Debug:
Operations: push(5), push(3), push(7), push(3), pop(), getMin(), pop(), getMin()
Step 0: Initialize
mainStack = []
minStack = []

Step 1: push(5)
Push into mainStack: [5]
minStack is empty → push 5 too: [5]
Stacks now:
mainStack = [5]
minStack = [5]

Step 2: push(3)
Push into mainStack: [5, 3]
Compare 3 with minStack.peek() = 5 → 3 ≤ 5 → push into minStack: [5, 3]
Stacks now:
mainStack = [5, 3]
minStack = [5, 3]

Step 3: push(7)
Push into mainStack: [5, 3, 7]
Compare 7 with minStack.peek() = 3 → 7 > 3 → do NOT push into minStack
Stacks now:
mainStack = [5, 3, 7]
minStack = [5, 3]

Step 4: push(3)
Push into mainStack: [5, 3, 7, 3]
Compare 3 with minStack.peek() = 3 → 3 ≤ 3 → push into minStack: [5, 3, 3]
Stacks now:
mainStack = [5, 3, 7, 3]
minStack = [5, 3, 3]

Step 5: pop()
Pop from mainStack: 3
Compare with minStack.peek() = 3 → equal → also pop from minStack
Stacks now:
mainStack = [5, 3, 7]
minStack = [5, 3]

Step 6: getMin()
Return minStack.peek() = 3 ✅

Step 7: pop()
Pop from mainStack: 7

Compare with minStack.peek() = 3 → not equal → do NOT pop from minStack

Stacks now:
mainStack = [5, 3]
minStack = [5, 3]

Step 8: getMin()
Return minStack.peek() = 3 ✅
📌
class MinStack {
    private Stack<Integer> mainStack;
    private Stack<Integer> minStack;

    public MinStack() {
        mainStack = new Stack<>();
        minStack = new Stack<>();
    }

    public void push(int val) {
        mainStack.push(val);

        if (minStack.isEmpty() || val <= minStack.peek()) {
            minStack.push(val);
        }
    }

    public void pop() {
        if (mainStack.peek().equals(minStack.peek())) {
            minStack.pop();
        }
        mainStack.pop();
    }

    public int top() {
        return mainStack.peek();
    }

    public int getMin() {
        return minStack.peek();
    }
}
