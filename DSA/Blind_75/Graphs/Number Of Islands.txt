✅Number Of Islands-Graphs
⚡Approch:::
1.Main Method:
	Build 2d array of char using 0 and 1
	Build Solution class
	Build noislands method
	Print the method
2.Class Solution:
    -public int method for islands:
	return 0 if grid is null or its length is 0
	Find rows and cols length also intialse count=0
	Run for loop and inside another for loop for both rows and cols
	If You find grid[i][j]==1 then increase count++
	Now inorder make all its beside as 0 we intialse dfs
	dfs of grid rows and cols	
    -private dfs method:
	boundary + water check row and col cannot be less than 0
	and also cannot be greater than or equals to length
	Soo basically when we came to (0,0) we had 1 soo we incease its 	count and jump into dfs and make that number as zero and also 	explore all four directions make zero
	Again at (2,2) we got 1 we increase count and make it has zero also 	explore four directions and make zero
	Again at (3,3) same
