✅Reverse Linked List
⚡Approch:
1.Intialise prev, and current equals to head
2.Run a while loop and check current value not equals to null
3.Then store next value in ListNode next
4.Now point current value to null to make reverse
5.Make prev equals to current to update previous value from null to zero then zero to 1 at last prev will be 3
6.Now move current value to next soo that it moves from 0 to 1 soo on until 3
7.Print the prev value now
📌
class Solution {
    public ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
        ListNode prev = null;
        ListNode curr = head;
        while (curr != null) {
            ListNode next = curr.next;
            curr.next = prev;          
            prev = curr;               
            curr = next;               
        }
        return prev; 
    }
}
